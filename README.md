Samson Society Google Calendar Automation

Depends on fetchmail and procmail
Retrieves mail from the piratemonkscal@gmail.com account
and processes the messages looking for invitations to
new meetings and if found, creating Google calendar
events.
Started writing it in bash, but then discovered the Google
Calendar API required a different language, in this case
Python. I'm working on a full Python version.
